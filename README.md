# CGIAR pipelines

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:

<!-- badges: end -->

This package has been developed primarily for computing breeding
analytic pipelines such as single trial analysis, multi-trial analysis,
population structure, etc. The focus of the package is pipelines related
to the use and understanding of evolutionary forces. Is currently
structured by evolutionary forces:

Selection modules

- Genetic evaluation modules

- Selection history modules

Mutation

- Gene discovery modules

- Mutation history modules

Gene flow and drift modules

- Gene frequencies modules

- Drift history modules

QC & Transformation modules

Please go to the package help pages to understand better each of the
modules and methods behind.

## Scope

The current scope is limited to enable Biometrical Genetics methods
recommended by the Quantitative Genetics community of the CGIAR
\[Excellence in Breeding (EiB) and collaborator centers, now Accelerated
Breeding Initiative (ABI)\] to standardize the methods and key
performance indicators (KPIs) used across the CGIAR for decision making.
For our collaborators, please keep this in mind when submitting pull
requests for new methods since these may not be accepted if the are not
under the current recommended approaches (see contribution process
below).

The target audience is the breeders and geneticists from the CGIAR but
this is a package that runs behind the scenes of the bioflow interface.

## Roles and responsabilities

In this project we have two different roles

Maintainers: Have the permission and responsibility to commit, push, and
merge changes. Contributor: Have the permission and responsibility to
commit, push using forked versions.

The current list of maintainers and contributors is the following:

Mainteiners: Khaled Al-Sham’aa, Ibnou Dieng, Eduardo Covarrubias, Angela
Pacheco

Contributor: Bert De Boeck, Raul Eizaguirre, Abhishek Rathore, Roma Das,
Keith Gardner, Fernando Toledo, Juan Burgueno, Aubin Amagnide, Luis
Delgado Munoz, Christian Cadena, Christian Werner, Sergio Cruz, Alaine
Gulles, Justine Bonifacio.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cgiarPipeline like this:

``` r
# devtools::install_github("Breeding-Analytics/cgiarPipeline")
```

You can clone the GitHub repository in your computer if you would like
to add something or make a change as

``` r
# git clone https://github.com/Breeding-Analytics/cgiarPipeline.git
```

## Contribution process

In this collaborative development model, anyone can fork an existing
repository and push changes to their personal fork. You do not need
permission from the original repository to push to your own fork. The
changes can be merged into the original repository by the project
maintainer. When you open a pull request proposing changes from your
user-owned fork to a branch in the source (upstream) repository, you can
allow anyone with push access to the upstream repository to make changes
to your pull request. This model is popular with open-source projects as
it reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and allows people
to work independently without upfront coordination.

For more details, please check the following guidelines:
<https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project>

### Contributing an R function or pipeline?

If you wish to contribute a function that can be used across modules
(e.g., a function to summarize data) please make your pull request to
the cgiarBase repository.

If you wish to contribute a pipeline in the form of an R function, make
sure that it can use the data structure proposed (an example can be
found calling data(example) in any of the packages) and submit your new
pipeline function to the cgiarPipeline repository.

If you wish to contribute a shiny module please make sure that it can
use the data structure proposed and make your pull request to the
bioflow repository.

### How is a contribution review and accepted?

Priority issues and functionalities will be posted in the confluence
space for internal and external collaborators interested in contributing
(link).

The submitted functions will be tested using a sample of multiple
datasets collected by the different centers to ensure that new functions
and interfaces perform well across a variety of scenarios.

### Types of contributions that will be accepted (check list)

Only contributions that met the following criteria will be accepted:

1)  Functions that contribute to the main goal of bioflow (see scope
    section above).

2)  Functions that enable methods approved by the Quantitative Genetics
    community lead by the Accelerated Breeding Initiative (before EiB).

3)  Functions that are proven better than existing methods, robust
    enough to handle the variability of data encountered across the
    CGIAR (use sample datasets to test your own function).
